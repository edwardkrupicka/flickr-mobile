# flickr-mobile
My first React-Native application.

### Abstract
A React-Native IOS mobile application that can search the Flickr REST API and display an infinite scrolling grid of images based on the search input.

### Goals 
The main goal of this application was to learn the basics of React Native and gain exposure to mobile applications. I based this project off of a coding techinical challenge that I created in React as a web application - [Flickr Image Search App](https://edwardkrupicka.github.io/flickr-search/).

## Wins
- Setting up the infinite scrolling was a challenge but very rewarding! I set up it so when the user gets to the bottom of the first page a fetch call is executed to retrieve the next page of result and add that onto the existing grid of images.
- Getting some expierence with React-Native, this was a fun project and I can't wait to make more mobile applications.

### Technology Used
- React-Native
- Xcode
- Expo Simulator
- JavaScript
