### Goals 
The main goal of this application was to learn the basics of React Native and gain exposure to mobile applications. I based this project off of a coding techinical challenge that I created in React as a web application - [Flickr Image Search App](https://edwardkrupicka.github.io/flickr-search/).

### Technology Used
